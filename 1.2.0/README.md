GMLspeak is a parser/lexer addon for [Catspeak (made by katsaii)](https://www.katsaii.com/catspeak-lang/), which enhances and brings more GML-like features directly on top of Catspeak.

!> While GMLspeak has more GML-like features, it still follows a lot of Catspeaks behaviours. Please see [Coming from GML](getting-started#coming-from-gml) for more info.

# Features
- Custom environment, parser and lexer built to aid right on top of Catspeak. (Future updates of Catspeak shouldn't break GMLspeak as much)
- Benefits of Catspeak directly transferred to GMLspeak.
- Proper scope passthrough (can recognize self/other)
- with syntax
- Custom method binding
- switch/case, for loop, do until loop, repeat loop, nullish and tenary operator support
- Most GML constants made available
